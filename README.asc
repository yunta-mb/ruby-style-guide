===== Source Code Layout =====

* Use `UTF-8` as the source file encoding.

* Use one tab character per *logical* indentation level. Use spaces for allignment.
+
[source]
---------------------------------
# bad - four spaces
def some_method
    do_something
end

# good - hard tab
def some_method
	do_something
end
---------------------------------

** Set visual width of tabs to whatever you prefer.
** If your tool can't handle showing/editing tabs the way you want it to - change your tool.
** If your pair-programming partner can't handle your tab width - change your partner.
** Copy-pasting doesn't really happen much, and re-formatting is easy.

* Use 2 empty lines between method (and class) definitions. Use 1 or more empty lines to break up methods
  into logical paragraphs internally.

---------------------------------
def some_method
	data = initialize(options)

	data.manipulate!

	data.result
